Debouncing: In these techniques no matter how many user fires the event, the attached function will excecuted after a specific delay.
In my project i have created debouncing code, where i am fetching my data on input search from api after a time delay of 2000ms.
My api will hit after a particular delay of 2000ms only, not on every key stock. So these help in resulting unwanted api calls on every hit
